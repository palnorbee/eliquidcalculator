<h2>A simple E-liquid calculator made with Python.</h1>


<p>The creator initially started the project due to a severe lack of existing projects.
Started just as a Python script, later got a makeover with the magic of Tkinter and PyBuilder.</p>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>The program takes your inputs and calculates the right amount you need for your recipe!
Currently, there is a limit for Aroma (additives) inputs (10), planning to add more in the future.

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>You can choose to download the executable file or the one directory version.</p>
